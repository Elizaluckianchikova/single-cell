This project is a comprehensive analysis of single-cell data using the `Scanpy` library for preprocessing and data analysis, as well as machine learning libraries from `scikit-learn` for classification and model evaluation. Here is a general description of the project:

### Project Objective
The goal of the project is to analyze gene expression in single-cell data to identify marker genes, cluster cells, and build classification models to predict cell groups based on gene expression.

### Main Project Stages

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Loading data from a `.h5ad` file format using `Scanpy`.
   - Handling possible errors during data loading, such as file absence.

2. **Gene Presence Check**:
   - Checking the presence of selected genes in the data. If any gene is missing, a `KeyError` exception is thrown.

3. **Marker Gene Calculation**:
   - Using `Scanpy` methods to calculate marker genes for each cluster.
   - Filtering marker genes by adjusted p-values to reduce the number of false discoveries.

4. **Creating Feature Matrix and Target Variable**:
   - Extracting data for the filtered marker genes into a feature matrix `X`.
   - Extracting class labels (clusters) into a vector `y`.

5. **Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets**:
   - Using `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn` to split the data into training and testing sets.

6. **Training a Classification Model**:
   - Training a classification model, such as `RandomForestClassifier`, on the training data.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Outputting a classification report using `classification_report`.
   - Outputting and visualizing the confusion matrix using `confusion_matrix` and `seaborn.heatmap`.

8. **Feature Importance Visualization**:
   - Plotting the feature importance graph to understand which genes are most important for class prediction.

### Used Libraries
- `Scanpy`: for single-cell data analysis.
- `scikit-learn`: for machine learning and model evaluation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: for data and results visualization.

### Conclusion
This project provides tools for the analysis and classification of single-cell data, which can be useful for researchers and specialists in the field of biology and bioinformatics. The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, starting from preprocessing and ending with the construction and evaluation of machine learning models..
